# Image Memorability Prediction
Progress in estimating visual memorability has been limited by the small scale and lack of variety of benchmark data. Here, we introduce a novel Deep CNN architecture, ResMemNet, to capture the memorability of the photographs  which is trained on the  publicly available annotated image memorability dataset to date (containing 60,000 images from diverse sources).
